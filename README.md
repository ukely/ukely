This is a collection of several songs written in [LilyPond](http://lilypond.org/) Notation for the ukulele. I prefer a "drop-g" or "low-g" tuning (the G string is one octave lower than standard ukulele tuning) so most songs are targetted for that tuning, though they often work just fine in a normal tuning.

In order to see the songs, you need Make and Lilypond installed. If you clone and run 'make' in the directory, that should produce `pdf` versions of the songs in a new `pdf` directory.
